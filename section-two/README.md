# Section Two

This is the first section where code is being implemented, therefore, there is no Section 1 in this repo.
The only code implemented in this section is the hello world JS script and practicing running it.

## How to run a JS script?
Once Node is installed on your system (by going to nodejs.org, downloading your preferred version, and installing it), you just need to run the following command:
```
node <name-of-script>.js
```
And that's it. That's how you run a NodeJS script. I'm sure there's more to it down the line, but that's the info covered in module two.
