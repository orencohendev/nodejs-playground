# NodeJS Playground
This repo is where I store all the code I write while learning NodeJS on the Udemy course - [The Complete Node.JS Developer](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/).

I will update this Readme as I go.

## Section One
This section is pure theory. No code was implemented during this section and therefore no code in this repo.

## Section Two
Beginning to code with a simple script to understand how to run a js file on nodejs. Some more details documented within the folder itself.

## Section Three
Beginning work on the notes app. Getting to know local and external modules and how to import them to use in our code.
